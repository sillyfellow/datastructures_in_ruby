# datastructures_in_ruby

I've used 'struct's to create some basic data structures in Ruby => linked
lists, binary tree, binary search tree, and AVL tree.

The trees do make use of inheritance very well. So, AVL tree's own code is
quite less (the rotations) because a lot of code is shared between binary tree,
and BST.
